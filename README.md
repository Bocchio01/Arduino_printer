# Arduino CNC plotter
A simple but functional all-in-one GUI app to control an Arduino CNC plotter.

No more software needed to control your small CNC machinery!

## Why another Arduino CNC code?
I realized that on Web lots of powerfull codes were already developed, but all of them required more than
one software to be installed on the PC (Hey come on.. I just want a pen to move, nothing more complex..).

In order to avoid this, I preferred to deploy my own all-in-one software which actually do the job excently.

## What's new here?
Written using only Python3, the app has lot of functions already integrated which gaves the possibility to:
- Print images: EVERY type of image
- Draw and print: Arduino will reproduce your hand-draw
- Write and print: if your home-printer is broken, this is a good solution :)
- Configure your CNC paramethers directly from the app

Let's have a look to the main features..

#
### Print images
You want to have a touchable version of the image you got on your pc-screen? Just select that image, software will do the heavy-job, and Arduino will print it!

#
### Draw and print
You want to use your Arduino as an extenctions on your arm? No problem: take your muose or graphical-tablet, draw everything you want to on the board, and Arduino will reproduce 
perfectly your draw.

#
### Write and print
You want to try a new text editor? You got it! Write what you want, align where you want, choose the font you want, and print it!

Lots of other examples can be found at [my website](http://bocchio.altervista.org/2021/Gorlu%20la%20stampante), but here's another one:

## Just to know..
For building this software I've used lots of Python libraries. The mains are:
- OpenCv + NumPy + PIL: for image analisys and data/bit manipulation
- Tkinter: for the Graphical User Interface itself
- Serial: for data sending, passing throught COM port

In order to run 'main.py', you have to install the libraries using pip command: 
```
pip install opencv-python pillow numpy pyserial tk
```

Let me underline that this was my first time Python approach. Probably in the lines of code lot of errors can be found, and that the reason of next paragraph..

## Contribute to this project!
If you have a great idea that could improve the app, or you have suggestion, or you simply want to leave a comment, don't exitate. Here nobody is wrong and we are all here to
improve and make it better every day!

Have a nice coding day,
